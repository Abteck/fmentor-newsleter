## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS - Css framework
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Throughout the course of this project, I understood alot more about email validation which made me to deep further and study password validation. I also learnt using click events listeners to hide and show the customized modal screen

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/unicode-characters.html) - This helped in getting unicodes for symbols (checkmarks, cancel etc). I fully recommend it to any one still finding it difficult to get the correct unicode combination for symbols or icons
